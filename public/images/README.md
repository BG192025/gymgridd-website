# Logo Instructions

Please add your logo file here with one of these names:
- `logo.png` (recommended)
- `logo.svg` (for vector graphics)

The logo should be:
- An octagon with a white spiral/maze pattern on black background (as described)
- High resolution (at least 200x200px for best quality)
- PNG format with transparency, or SVG format

The website code is already set up to use `/images/logo.png`, so just add your file with that name!
